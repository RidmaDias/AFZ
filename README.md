# AFZ
Honeypot + Mitre Mapped Attack Free Zone


At the heart of the AFZ system lies the concept of a honeypotâ€”an intentionally crafted deceptive network resource. While honeypots are not new to the realm of cybersecurity, AFZ takes this concept to new heights with advanced capabilities and integration. A traditional honeypot serves as a trap to lure and divert potential attackers, isolating them from valuable network assets. AFZ, however, transcends the conventional honeypot by incorporating ML-driven threat analysis and classification.

AFZ identifies and categorizes threats into four primary objectives based on the MITRE framework:

1. Credential Access: Threats falling under this category involve techniques and methods employed by attackers to obtain valid usernames and passwords, granting them access to systems and resources requiring authentication.
2. Privilege Escalation: Within this classification, AFZ identifies logs indicating attempts to elevate access or permissions within compromised systems. Privilege escalation is a critical step for attackers seeking to expand their control over the network.
3. Execution: Techniques used by attackers to execute malicious code or arbitrary commands on target systems are categorized under this stage. Execution often marks the point at which an attack transitions from initial infiltration to active exploitation.
4. Resource Development: Activities undertaken by attackers to create or acquire tools and resources for their operations fall under this classification. Resource development includes the preparation and customization of malicious tools and infrastructure.
